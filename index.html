    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <article>
      <p>The Tour de Fraz started as a way for Jerry (aka Fraz) to blow off steam from his job at the hospital. He
        and his friends would go on hours long ride in the Chicagoland area. Fraz also organized longer bike-packing
        trips
        with a couple of friends through Kentucky and Wisconsin. The tours were typically 5 to 9 days long where the
        guys
        stayed at cheap hotels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fraz’s favorite bike trip was through Wisconsin along the Elroy-Sparta trail, part of the rails-to-trails
        network, featuring old
        railroad tunnels. He recalled one summer his new tires and tubes kept going flat. He called his wife, Vic, to
        come
        pick him up. On a Friday, Vic drove up to Wisconsin with her brother, Steve, to rescue Fraz. That night, they
        went
        out for dinner at a fish fry restaurant, however, the fryer was broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once Fraz had kids and those kids were old enough to ride, the rides shifted from weeklong excursions to shorter
        day trips. Oftentimes, the rides were still along rails-to-trails in Illinois with easy turnaround points for
        tired legs. At the end of the ride, all the participants would join in a potluck lunch for sandwiches, sides and
        dessert. These yearly events became known as the <span class="racingText">Tour de Fraz</span>.</p>

        The next Tour de Fraz is tentatively scheduled for Saturday, September 14, 2025. We will try to keep to the
        second Saturday of September. We will ride along the same path as the previous year: starting in Frisco and
        turning around at Vail Pass. There is a good halfway point in Copper Mountain Village.

      <h2>Inaugural - 2024</h2>
      <p>

        The inaugural Tour de Fraz - Colorado ride was on Saturday, September 14, 2024. We had 10 riders show up to
        honor
        Fraz’s name and legacy. The ride took place along Ten Mile Canyon Trail, starting in Frisco, CO, and ending at
        Vail Pass. It was a beautiful day with perfect weather.
      </p>

      <p>
        Donations were collected and given to Parkinson’s Champions. Between funds collected the day of the ride and a
        company matching program, a total of $1,400 was raised for Parkinson’s research. This was an impressive giving
        from
        the group of riders.

      <p>In 2017, Fraz was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. His diagnosis hasn't stopped him from being an

        the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.parkinson.org/?utm_source=TourdeFraz">Parkinson’s
